Newly Designed AI Chatbox

Welcome to my repo Next AI! This is a newly designed chat box that provides information extraction service on uploaded PDF files.  
The user interaction with the software mainly consists of two ways: text and voice! Just one clicked to start a conversation with "Nexty"!  
Technical introduction:  
I Implemented high-performance RESTful APIs with Express and Node.js, optimizing request handling and improving response times by 40%.  
I Utilized an in-memory vector store to cache embeddings, significantly reducing retrieval times.  
I Integrated OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo API and Langchain technologies, creating a sophisticated AI Agent capable of  
document loading, splitting, storage, and efficient output.  

To use my app, clone this repo and in the next level nextai folder run 'npm install' and 'npm run dev'.
